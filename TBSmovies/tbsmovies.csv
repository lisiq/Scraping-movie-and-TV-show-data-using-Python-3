But it gets seriously derailed when a drunken one-nighter with slacker Ben Stone results in an unwanted pregnancy. Faced with the prospect of going it alone or getting to know the baby's father, Alison decides to give the lovable doof a chance. An overgrown kid who has no desire to settle down, Ben learns that he has a big decision to make with his kid's mom-to-be: will he hit the road or stay in the picture! Courting a woman you've just knocked up, however, proves to be a little difficult when the two try their hands at dating. As they discover more about one another, it becomes painfully obvious that they're not the soul mates they'd hoped they might be. With Alison's harried sister Debbie and hen-pecked brother-in-law Pete the only parenting role models the young lovers have, things get even more confusing. Should they raise the baby together? What makes a happy lifetime partnership after all? A couple of drinks and a wild night later, they've got nine confusing months to figure it out.",Alison Scott is an up-and-coming entertainment journalist whose 24-year-old life is on the fast track.

The Duke's family business is moonshine, and the boys' Uncle Jesse concocts the tastiest brew in Dixie. More often than not, the boys find themselves on the wrong side of the law as they race to make their deliveries, leading the sheriff's department on some truly wild goose chases in their infamous orange Dodge Charger, the General Lee. After a long day on the job, there's nothing like relaxing with an ice cold beer at Hazzard County's finest drinking establishment, The Boar's Nest, where Daisy waits tables. From time to time, an out-of-towner makes the mistake of getting a little too familiar with the most beautiful girl in Hazzard Country. They quickly find out, the hard way, that Daisy isn't just a pretty face--she kicks ass like a Duke; and with Bo and Luke in the mix, that usually means a good old-fashioned knock-down, drag-out bar brawl. But it's not all moonshine and farm girls these days---when Bo and Luke discover evidence that their neighbors' properties are being unlawfully seized by crooked commissioner Boss Hogg, their only chance to protect their hometown is to put the 'pedal to the medal' in a last-ditch scheme to save Hazzard County.",,PG-13,False,,,,32c8f2479f6251fb215368e76dd32c3e9402b25b,1,\/movies\/the-dukes-of-hazzard-uncut,https:\/\/www.tbs.com\/movies\/the-dukes-of-hazzard-uncut,6247.9751,2005,104 min,10,,,,1,"{'banner': 'NaN', 'rectangle': 'NaN', 'display_presented': True, 'sponsor_120x42': 'NaN', 'mobile_ad': 'NaN', 'display_ad_inventory_id': 'NaN'}",[],Watch On the App,https:\/\/tbs.app.link\/PDhQlsZHj5,1585728000,1587455999,,,Expires April 20,Expires Tomorrow,False,Expires Tomorrow,"{'main_846x700': {'fid': '17965', 'url': 'https:\\/\\/images.tbs.com\\/tbs\\/$dyna_params\\/https%3A%2F%2Fi.cdn.tbs.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2F2020%2F03%2FDukes-846x700.jpg', 'type': 'video'}, 'main_1024x1536': {'fid': '17961', 'url': 'https:\\/\\/images.tbs.com\\/tbs\\/$dyna_params\\/https%3A%2F%2Fi.cdn.tbs.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2F2020%2F03%2FDukes-1024x1536.jpg', 'type': 'video'}, 'main_1600x900': {'fid': '17963', 'url': 'https:\\/\\/images.tbs.com\\/tbs\\/$dyna_params\\/https%3A%2F%2Fi.cdn.tbs.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2F2020%2F03%2FDukes-1600x900.jpg', 'type': 'video'}, 'main_1692x695': {'fid': '17964', 'url': 'https:\\/\\/images.tbs.com\\/tbs\\/$dyna_params\\/https%3A%2F%2Fi.cdn.tbs.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2F2020%2F03%2FDukes-1692x695.jpg', 'type': 'video'}, 'tvapps_1920xjpg': {'fid': '17962', 'url': 'https:\\/\\/images.tbs.com\\/tbs\\/$dyna_params\\/https%3A%2F%2Fi.cdn.tbs.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2F2020%2F03%2FDukes-1920x1080.jpg', 'type': 'video'}, 'main_2048x1536': {'fid': '17960', 'url': 'https:\\/\\/images.tbs.com\\/tbs\\/$dyna_params\\/https%3A%2F%2Fi.cdn.tbs.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2F2020%2F03%2FDukes-2048x1536.jpg', 'type': 'video'}}",,,WatchAction,en,US,2020-04-01T08:00:00+00:00,2020-04-21T07:59:59+00:00,TBS,TVE
